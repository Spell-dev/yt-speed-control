# YouTube Speed Control

YouTube Speed Control is a browser extension that allows you to set a fixed playback speed for all YouTube videos using a custom speed setting and keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

- Set a custom playback speed for YouTube videos.
- Adjust playback speed using keyboard shortcuts:
  - Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down (currently not working properly)
  - macOS: Cmd+Up / Cmd+Down 
  - Custom shortcut assignment is currently not fully functional
- Displays the current speed as a badge (if it's not the default 1.0x).
- Modern, user-friendly popup interface.
- Built with Manifest V3 for Google Chrome.

## Browser Support

Currently, this version of the extension is developed for **Google Chrome** (Manifest V3).  
I plan to offer versions for other browsers in the future. Contributions to extend compatibility and further develop the app are very welcome!
